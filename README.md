# CS661 Course Project - Fake News Analysis Dashboard

## Project Overview
This repository contains the work for our CS661 Course Project: a Fake News Analysis Dashboard suite. The project consists of a central homepage and several distinct analysis modules developed by different team members.

-   **Homepage:** Developed using React + Vite + Node.js (Managed by Sankhadeep). Located in `Module_Sankhadeep/client/`.
-   **Modules:** Developed using Python + Flask + D3.js (and potentially other libraries). Located in their respective folders:
    -   `Module_Piyush_Ravi/`: Word Analysis Dashboard (Your Module)
    *   `Module_Ananya_Arpita/Celeb_news/`: Celebrity News Analysis Module
    *   (Add other Flask module folders here)
-   **Shared Data:** Located in the top-level `data/` folder.

This README provides guidance on both the development workflow and how to run the fully integrated project for presentation.

## Development Workflow (Using Git)

ðŸš¨ **Important:** Follow these steps carefully to collaborate effectively and avoid conflicts. **Do NOT make changes directly on the `main` branch during development.**

### Step 1: Initial Setup (First time only)
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    Open the Terminal app on your Mac and run:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Piyushiitk24/CS661_Course_Project.git
    cd CS661_Course_Project
    ```
2.  **Install Prerequisites**:
    *   Ensure you have **Node.js** installed (check with `node -v`). Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if needed (includes npm). Use the LTS version recommended for the React project if known.
    *   Ensure you have **Python 3** installed (check with `python3 -V`).
    *   Ensure you have **Git** installed.

### Step 2: Create Your Own Branch (Essential!)
Always work on your own branch to isolate your changes. Replace `yourname_feature` with a descriptive name (e.g., `piyush_wordcloud_updates`).

1.  **Create & Switch to New Branch**:
    ```bash
    # Make sure you are up-to-date with main first (optional but good practice)
    # git checkout main
    # git pull origin main

    # Create your new branch
    git checkout -b yourname_feature
    ```
2.  **Verify Your Branch**:
    ```bash
    git branch
    ```
    Your branch should have a `*` next to it.

### Step 3: Work on Your Module
-   Make changes **only** within your assigned module's folder (e.g., `Module_Piyush_Ravi/` or `Module_Ananya_Arpita/Celeb_news/`).
-   For Flask modules, manage dependencies using a virtual environment *inside your module folder* (see Presentation Setup below for details). Update your module's `requirements.txt` if you add packages (`pip freeze > requirements.txt`).
-   **Do NOT modify other team members' module folders or the React Homepage code unless coordinated.**

### Step 4: Save and Share Your Work
Commit your changes frequently and push your branch to GitHub.

1.  **Stage Changes**:
    ```bash
    # Stage changes only within your module folder
    git add Module_YourName/
    # Or stage all tracked changes if confident
    # git add .
    ```
2.  **Commit Changes**:
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your descriptive commit message (e.g., Fix word cloud color scale)"
    ```
3.  **Push to GitHub**:
    ```bash
    git push origin yourname_feature
    ```

### Step 5: Create Pull Requests (PRs)
When a feature is complete or you want feedback, create a Pull Request on GitHub from your branch (`yourname_feature`) targeting the `main` branch. Add reviewers. **Do not merge your own PRs** until approved and coordinated for final integration.

### Step 6: Stay Synced
Regularly update your branch with changes from `main` to minimize merge conflicts later:
```bash
# Switch to main and pull latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Switch back to your branch
git checkout yourname_feature

# Merge main into your branch
git merge main
```
Resolve any merge conflicts that arise (ask for help if needed).

## Running the Integrated Demo for Presentation (Checklist)

This section details how to set up and run the **entire project** (React Homepage + all Flask modules) on a single Mac for the final presentation using the **Hyperlink integration method**. Follow these steps precisely on the chosen presentation Mac.

### âœ… Step 1: Prerequisites Check
Ensure the following are installed and working on the **presentation Mac**:
1.  [ ] **Node.js & npm:** Check with `node -v` in Terminal. (Install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if needed).
2.  [ ] **Python 3 & pip:** Check with `python3 -V` in Terminal. (Should be pre-installed on macOS).
3.  [ ] **Git:** Check with `git --version`. (Should be pre-installed on macOS).
4.  [ ] **VS Code (Recommended):** For easily managing multiple terminals.

### âœ… Step 2: Setup Project Folder & Code
1.  [ ] **Clone/Locate Project:** Ensure the main project folder (`CS661_Course_Project`) exists on the presentation Mac (e.g., `~/Desktop/CS661_Demo`).
    ```bash
    # Example: Navigate to the project folder
    cd /path/to/your/CS661_Demo
    ```
2.  [ ] **Verify Structure:** Confirm all module folders (`Module_Sankhadeep`, `Module_Piyush_Ravi`, `Module_Ananya_Arpita`, etc.) and the shared `data/` folder are present inside `CS661_Demo`.
3.  [ ] **Pull Latest Code:** Get the most recent, integrated version.
    ```bash
    # Ensure you are in the main project directory (e.g., CS661_Demo)
    git checkout main # Or the final presentation branch name
    git pull origin main # Or the final presentation branch name
    ```

### âœ… Step 3: Install Dependencies (Separate Environments!)

**(A) React Homepage Dependencies (`Module_Sankhadeep/client/`)**
1.  [ ] Open Terminal (or a pane in VS Code's integrated terminal).
2.  [ ] Navigate to the React **client** directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/CS661_Demo/Module_Sankhadeep/client
    ```
3.  [ ] **Troubleshooting:** If `node_modules` exists and you face issues, try removing it first: `rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json` (Use with caution!).
4.  [ ] Install Node modules:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    *(Watch for any errors during installation. If errors occur, check Node.js version compatibility or specific package issues and ask the React teammate.)*

**(B) Your Flask Module Dependencies (`Module_Piyush_Ravi`)**
1.  [ ] Open a **NEW** Terminal tab/pane.
2.  [ ] Navigate to **your** module directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/CS661_Demo/Module_Piyush_Ravi
    ```
3.  [ ] Create/Activate **separate** virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *(Prompt should show `(venv)`)*
4.  [ ] Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

**(C) Ananya/Arpita Flask Module Dependencies (`Module_Ananya_Arpita`)**
1.  [ ] Open a **NEW** Terminal tab/pane.
2.  [ ] Navigate to **their** module directory:
    ```bash
    cd /path/to/your/CS661_Demo/Module_Ananya_Arpita
    ```
3.  [ ] Create/Activate **separate** virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv2 # Or any unique name
    source venv2/bin/activate
    ```
    *(Prompt should show `(venv2)`)*
4.  [ ] Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming they have one
    # If no requirements.txt, install manually: pip install Flask Flask-Cors pandas spacy
    ```
5.  [ ] **Install SpaCy Model:**
    ```bash
    python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
    ```

**(D) Other Flask Modules:**
1.  [ ] Repeat steps C.1-C.4 for **each** additional Flask module. Use a unique virtual environment name (e.g., `venv3`, `venv4`) inside each module's directory. Install dependencies via `requirements.txt` or manually.

### âœ… Step 4: Verify Port Assignments & React Links
1.  [ ] **Confirm Ports:** Ensure each server has a unique port. Default plan:
    *   React Homepage: Port `5173` (Vite default) or `3000`. **Check its startup message.**
    *   Your Module: Port `5001`.
    *   Ananya/Arpita Module: Port `5002`.
    *   Other Flask Modules: Ports `5003`, `5004`, etc.
2.  [ ] **Verify React Links:** Confirm the React Homepage code (`Module_Sankhadeep/client/src/modules/Home.jsx` or similar) has the correct `http://127.0.0.1:<PORT>` URLs in the `onClick={() => window.open(module.url, '_blank')}` or `<a href="..." target="_blank">` for each **Flask module**. Internal React routes should use relative paths (e.g., `/timeline`).

### âœ… Step 5: Run All Servers Simultaneously (The Demo!)

Open one terminal tab/pane **per server**. Use VS Code's integrated terminal for easier management. Keep all panes running.

!!!IMPORTANT!!! Make sure you have Node.js installed in your machine!!!

!!!IMPORTANT!!! Make sure you have the items listed in the requirements.txt installed in the python environment 
you intend to use (whether the system-wide default python environment, or one created using venv)!!!

*   **Pane 1: React Homepage**
    1.  Navigate:
        ```bash
            cd /path/to/your/CS661_Course_Project/Module_Sankhadeep/client
        ```
    2.  Ensure you have the "node_modules" folder in this directory. If not, then (assuming you have Node.js 
        installed in your system) run:
        ```bash
            npm install
        ```
    3. Run the Node.js server:
        ```bash
            npm run dev -- --port=5173
        ```

*   **Pane 2: Your Flask Module (Port 5001)**
    1.  Navigate:
        ```bash
            cd /path/to/your/CS661_Course_Project/Module_Piyush_Ravi
        ```

    2.  If you intend to use a venv created python virtual environment then activate that (otherwise simply skip 
        this step):
        ```bash
            source <path_to_the_virtual_environment>/bin/activate
        ```

    3.  Run Flask:
        ```bash
            flask run --port=5001
        ```

*   **Pane 3: Ananya/Arpita Module (Port 5002)**
    1.  Navigate:
        ```bash
            cd /path/to/your/CS661_Course_Project/Module_Ananya_Arpita
        ```
        
    2.  If you intend to use a venv created python virtual environment then activate that (otherwise simply skip 
        this step):
        ```bash
            source <path_to_the_virtual_environment>/bin/activate
        ```

    3.  Run Flask:
        ```bash
            flask run --port=5002
        ```

*   **Pane 4: Aakriti Module (Port 5174)**
    1.  Navigate:
        ```bash
            cd /path/to/your/CS661_Course_Project/Module_Aakriti
        ```
        
    2.   Ensure you have the "node_modules" folder in this directory. If not, then (assuming you have Node.js 
        installed in your system) run:
        ```bash
            npm install
        ```

    3.  Run the Node.js server:
        ```bash
            npm run dev -- --port=5174
        ```

*   **Pane 5: Disha/Khushi Module (Port 5003)**
    1.  Navigate:
        ```bash
            cd /path/to/your/CS661_Course_Project/Module_Disha_Khushi
        ```
        
    2.  If you intend to use a venv created python virtual environment then activate that (otherwise simply skip 
        this step):
        ```bash
            source <path_to_the_virtual_environment>/bin/activate
        ```

    3.  Run Flask:
        ```bash
            flask run --port=5003
        ```

### âœ… Step 6: Test the Integrated Demo
1.  [ ] Open a web browser.
2.  [ ] Go to the **React Homepage URL** from Pane 1 (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
3.  [ ] Click the link/button for **Piyush/Ravi's Module**. Verify it opens in a new tab at `http://127.0.0.1:5001` and works.
4.  [ ] Go back to the React Homepage tab. Click the link for **Ananya/Arpita's module**. Verify it opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5002` and works.
5.  [ ] Go back to the React Homepage tab. Click the link for **Aakriti's module**. Verify it opens at `http://localhost:5174` and works.
6.  [ ] Go back to the React Homepage tab. Click the link for **Disha/Khushi's module**. Verify it opens at `http://127.0.0.1:5003` and works.

### âœ… Step 7: Presentation Execution
1.  Before starting, run all servers using the commands in Step 5. **Ensure no errors.**
2.  Open the React Homepage URL in the browser.
3.  Click links to open Flask and other React modules in new tabs.
4.  Switch between tabs to demo.
5.  **Keep all terminal windows/panes running!**

## Final Integration (Post-Demo / Code Merge)
-   (Keep existing section - This describes merging PRs for the final codebase merge, separate from the demo setup)
-   Each personâ€™s branch (e.g., `Ananya_Arpita_feature`, `piyush_feature`) will be reviewed via Pull Requests.
-   Once everyoneâ€™s work is ready, weâ€™ll merge all branches into `main`.
-   Weâ€™ll resolve any conflicts together as a team.
