!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Ensure you have Python and Node.js (with npm) installed on your system !!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1. Manually look into the "CS661_Course_Project/Module_Aakriti" and "CS661_Course_Project/Module_Sankhadeep/client"
folders for a folder named "node_modules". If it is present, move onto the next step. If not present (or if you get 
any error in Step 5 below) then navigate to (or open) in a terminal in those folders one by one and run:
```bash
	npm install
```

Close the terminal when the installs complete.



2. In a new terminal navigate to (or open) the "CS661_Course_Project" folder


 
3. Activate your python virtual environment if you intend to use one that you created earlier (otherwise skip this step):
```bash
	<path_to_the_virtual_environment>/bin/activate
```


4. Run (if you are trying to run the project for the first time in your machine, otherwise skip this step):
```bash
	pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Wait for the installs to finish.



5. Run:
```bash
	python start_all.py
```

Let this server terminal run in the background for the entire duration you would like to visit the project webpages.



6. Open a browser and paste the following link and the project Homepage will open up: http://localhost:5173



7. !!! IMPORTANT !!! When you are done and wish to close the project, to properly stop the servers and free up the ports for reuse:
	
	i.   Simply close the server terminal
	ii.  Then in a new terminal navigate to (or open) the "CS661_Course_Project" folder
	iii. Then run:
		```bash
			python3 stop_all.py
		```

Done! Close the terminal.
